Warm-up: Getting Started + Bisection Method
• Read https://github.com/Lejeune-Lab-Graduate-Course-Materials/setup-example and
follow the instructions to get started.
• Implement a bisection method solver using TDD and good coding and documentation practices. Please consider error handling as well.
• Create a tutorial for using your solver with at least 5 example problems, at least 2 of which
must be related to mechanics.
Part 1: Newton’s Method
• Implement a Newton’s method solver using TDD and good coding and documentation practices. Please consider error handling as well.
• Create a tutorial for using your solver with at least 5 example problems, at least 2 of which
must be related to mechanics (example problems can match the Bisection Method, though
they should be chosen to highlight the functionality/limitations of the Newton’s method solver
as needed).
Part 2: 1D Elasto-plastic Material Model
• Implement an elasto-plastic material model with kinematic hardening and an elasto-plastic
material model with isotropic hardening using TDD and good coding and documentation
practices.
• Create a tutorial for using your code with at least 5 example problems.
